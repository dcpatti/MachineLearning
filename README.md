Exploring Kepler plantetary dataset with SVM and neural network.  Observations:

 
Both models are more accurate at identifying false positives than confirming positive identifications.

Adding layers to the neural network slightly decreases accuracy (0.8916 with 3 total layers, 0.8606 with 4 layers)

The support vector machine is slightly less accurate when classifying this dataset than the neural network, but tuning the SVM with gridsearch improves its accuracy to nearly match the neural network's.
